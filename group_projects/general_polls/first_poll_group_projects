To keep the progress nicely visible to everyone we'd have to manage a project board so everything is nicely active, and everyone has a chance to see what's going on
11(65%) voted for using Trello.
Trello will be used for the project board management.

How actively would you be able contribute with us?(Yea, this one is wacky because it dont make much sense as a poll, but I was curious how many are actively interested.)
8(47%), most people will contribute when they feel like it.

The project we'll be working on has to be on version control one way or another. That being said, we'll have to decide if we'd prefer to work on open-source or closed source projects. Which would you prefer?
14(82%) wants to choose between Open Source and Closed Source depending on the projects we have on hand, and wants to decide later, together!
We shall decide together about the project details regarding Open Source and Closed Source for each individual project.
Most likely with a poll.
